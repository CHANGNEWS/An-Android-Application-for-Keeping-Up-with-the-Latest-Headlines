# An-Android-Application-for-Keeping-Up-with-the-Latest-Headlines


A bit overview, it uses newsapi.org API to get news and get JSON data back. Then it is parsed using google's gson library and the requests are sent by Retrofit.

Note: To run the app you have to add https://newsapi.org key. I have taken this step to due to limited access to daily request for News. Getting a key would take just few seconds :)
